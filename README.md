Sentiment Prediction API Using FastAPI and Youtubeâ€™s API

Objective:- The objective of this lab experiment is to create a sentiment prediction API using FastAPI, 
which analyzes Twitter tweets for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This lab 
integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques with a lightweight and high- 
performance API framework.

Procedure:- (Steps Followed)
1. Install the required Python libraries: FastAPI,TextBlob, scikit-learn, 
pandas, and uvicorn. 
2. Create a youtube Developer account. 
3. Create a new application to obtain API keys 	 
4. Use TextBlob or a similar NLP library to perform sentiment analysis on tweet text. 
5. Define categories for sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) based on the 
polarity score. 
6. Create a function that takes text as input and returns the sentiment category.
